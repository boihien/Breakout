# Breakout
The goal of breakout is to knock out all of the wall particles before the number of lives run out. You control a paddle and attempt to hit the ball that is coming back. Once the entire wall is broken down, the user wins. If the ball enters the out of bounds area without hitting the paddle, the number of lives is decremented. If this happens fives times, the user loses. The game is controlled with an SNES controller and is displayed by an 8x8 LED Matrix.
